## Amy's Advent of Code 2021

My solutions for Advent of Code 2021.

My main language is [Crystal](https://crystal-lang.org/), and this is what I write solutions in first.

The objectives for my Crystal solutions are:
* Be simple.
* Be clean.
* Be concise.

### Other languages?

Each year I try to port my solutions to a new language that I'm trying to learn. This year's new language hasn't been decided yet.

Sometimes I write solutions in other languages when I feel like it and/or have the energy for it.
