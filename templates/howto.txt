This is the directory containing project templates for various languages.
Each template is a directory, and in that directory are all of the files and folders for the template that will be copied when making a new project.
If a template has a file named "input.txt" then it will be symlinked to "input.txt" in the puzzle's root directory, which is created if it doesn't exist. This allows all solutions for the same puzzle to share the same input file.
Templates for C, Python, and Rust are included. Feel free to use them as exmaples and/or modify them!
The only reserved template name is "blank". A custom template named "blank" will simply be ignored.
